# Layout to code

## Overview

- _Fork & clone this repository._
- Using the two PDFs, determine the most semantically appropriate HTML tag for each numbered content
- There are two PDFs:
  `layout-to-code.pdf`
  — Just the plain website wireframe, by itself
  `layout-to-code-numbered.pdf`
  — A messier version showing each numbered tag
- _Submit your HTML tag choices with explanations._

## Hand in

On GitHub’s website, on your forked repository, create an Issue labeled “Solution”—and tag your teacher.

**Record yourself speaking the answers—and upload/drop it into the GitHub Issue body.** (You’ll have to _zip_ the audio file before GitHub will allow you to drop it into an Issue.)

Read out the number, the semantically appropriate HTML tag & your explanation. Here’s an example of what the recording would sound like (using different content).
